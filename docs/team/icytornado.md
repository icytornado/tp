## Project: App-Ointment

App-Ointment is a patient appointment management software adapted from AddressBook - Level 3, which is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 19 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=icytornado)

* **Features Implemented**:
  * Implementation of the `edit-appt` feature:
    - *Description*:
        - `edit-appt` command allow the user to edit an existing appointment by changing the fields for the appointment.
        - `edit-appt` + `index` + `field` to edit => edit the specified field of the appointment specified by the appointment index.
        - the `field` to edit is preceded by its related prefix, i.e. `pt/` for patient, `dr/` for doctor, `at/` for appointment start date and time, `to/` for appointment end date and time, `dur/` for appointment duration, `/t` for appointment tags.
    
  * Collaborated with teammates in the implementation of `Doctor` feature and its command features.
    - *Description*:
        - list of `Doctor`commands: `add-doctor`, `delete-doctor`, `list-doctor`,`find-doctor`, `clear-doctor`, `edit-doctor`.
